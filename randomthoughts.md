Random thoughts about improvements:
- Add decoders for fields, so that we don't have to use casting in generated code
- Support class inputs by making sub forms in the UI
- Support collections by making extendable sub forms in the UI
- Support enums by making dropdowns in the UI
- Support optional fields in the UI
- Add logging, so that all the operations are stored in a log file
- Add field names to the UI
